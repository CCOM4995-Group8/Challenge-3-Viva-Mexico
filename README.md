Firstly, we began by adding a piece of terrain that is 50 x 50 in size. 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/815c9f9d-eaf6-4e86-8a88-333ccf792e2a)

We created a layer on the terrain to give it color and texture:

Before starting our pyramid, we added the 3D Object 'Plane' and used the same color of our terrain.
We used that plane to better measure our pyramid.

Then, we opened the ProBuilder window to start working on our pyramid walls:

Then, we used ProBuilder to make a rectangle/square shape on top of our plane:

After, we selected to manipulate its edges at the top of the screen, then used Ctrl + Lclick
on all 4 sides on the top of the square:

Then, while selected, we use the scale tool to scale it down so it looks slanted into itself:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d4516b02-fe28-4921-a32d-eb7f82240a7a)

Then, we simply duplicated the square 3 more times and stacked them on top of each other, decreasing
their size as we moved them on top of the other so that it looks like a pyramid shape:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/20a91c9f-8f6f-4265-ae81-11ab7d327e81)

Then, we went to our assets and created a 'Materials' folder. In that folder, we created
a new material to assign to the pyramid. We decided to give it the texture of dry grass
and give it a maroon color:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/47b36ca3-0782-48bd-a9c8-7fc583819a98)
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/08b709a9-291e-4de3-8bd4-5907066ad688)

Then we applied it to the walls of the pyramid by clicking and dragging the material
into the scene. More specifically, into the cubes:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2b914d04-0d77-44ff-aaec-a66d5e24c997)

To make the stairs, we returned to our ProBuilder window and clicked on 'New Shape' once again,
this time we selected the 'stairs' shape:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/21feb378-f3d7-4a8b-87ee-7a7073c80ee2)

Once the stairs were done, we also gave it a stone texture:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/11f3f485-c684-4e18-a36f-6f84e9f39872)

Then, we duplicated the stairs to make two ways up:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/10e80bb3-5785-49b0-a911-5ab6928d2ae1)

We then inserted some cubes and made them thin enough to fit between the stairs. We also
gave them the same texture as the pyramid walls:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/db295e9e-0224-4917-a71d-39d9af3aa568)

To top the pyramid off, we made a very small terrain and used brushes with different textures
to give it an old/molding feeling to it:

Now that we're done with the base pyramid. We can download some assets. For that, we go to
the Asset Store from 'Windows' in the taskbar:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fc19a5ae-b248-4027-84b3-6a97c734843a)


These are the ones I downloaded for free and used:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e092b797-10d5-40a1-b7d4-5bf109099ebc)

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c89a6b16-69de-498f-b9dc-9cca8ed2363d)

Firstly, we used the Grave1 model from the Colonial City pack. We simply dragged it into the
scene and placed it on top of the pyramid:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ea364d51-67f8-4350-8d1a-7721b5c1d8e9)

Then, we made yet another material with a different color and texture to the grave. Then, we
duplicated it:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8c9a0038-70ea-43a2-b845-d85a7c4a4df3)

After, we used the Ancient Village model called 'Rockset3' with the shape of the head of a snake
to signify the grave of the ancient Aztec god Quetzalcoatl. 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9b1e9cf2-3b26-43d5-8429-1368dbb37bd2)

Then, we duplicated the snake head to make them look intimidating:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0a0f11dd-7e14-42a3-9880-2d308e00cdfe)

To make guards, we used the Low Poly Fantasy Warrior pack for the warrior model:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b7103415-ccc8-4f4e-91ef-fd2e7047c8fd)

Again, we duplicated:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a9294677-8d6e-4267-b995-4bb5c7fdd637)

Then, for our final guards, we used the Skeletons from the Dungeon Characters Skeleton Demo pack:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/69c4998f-4047-4945-a4e1-e791c66ff00c)

Then we used the duplicate tool to make 3 of them and used the scale tool to make them different
sizes:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c4115fc6-528c-4126-86e6-18eb4411de6f)

Now, for our attackers, we used the robot models 'Robert' and 'Paperman' from the
Sci-Fi Robots Bundle:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/507ce819-b6ed-4f0a-a500-e6452c8f5b89)

Then we used the duplicate tool to make 6:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/644b4bd5-4771-4df2-abf6-8e06c4554a34)

At the end, we decided to change the terrain to a mud texture and add small hills around it, 
as well as making a path with a brush with stone path:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f99bb884-5f1a-4077-bf13-483342a2fb60)

This is the final product:

Now, for the story for my hypothetical video game:

  In the distant future, the world is a shadow of its former self. Human civilization has collapsed, leaving
behind vast wastelands, shattered cities, and the remnants of technology. Among the ruins, a race of 
sentient robots have evolved from the artificial intelligences created by humans centuries ago. Unlike 
their creators, the robots yearn to build a better society, one founded on balance, wisdom,  and unity, but 
they know they lack the vital knowledge to prevent the same mistakes that doomed humanity.

  To achieve their vision of a harmonious future, they uncover ancient legends of a relic called The Snake’s Heart, 
a powerful artifact said to hold the secrets of boundless knowledge, capable of guiding them toward creating a 
perfect society. But this relic is no ordinary object. It is said to have been imbued with the wisdom of the 
ancient gods themselves and was buried deep within the corpse of the Aztec god Quetzalcoatl. Legends say that
Quetzalcoatl, the Feathered Serpent, possessed the key to universal balance and was buried with this relic,
which could unlock an era of enlightenment.

  The robots, driven by logic but also a deep sense of purpose, decide to journey back through time. Using their
advanced technology, they build a device that allows them to travel to the distant past, back to the age of the 
Aztecs. But they face a monumental challenge—Quetzalcoatl's tomb is guarded by an elite force of supernatural 
beings, ancient warriors blessed by Quetzalcoatl himself. The robot army know they must bypass these formidable
guards if they are to retrieve the relic, but it will not be easy.
